## **About**
Linear Algebra Library is a C++ project that provides access to different Linear Algebra tools and methods. It can be used in other projects or to help students understand and learn Linear Algebra.

Current version of library contains:
- Own Matrix class with different methods to operate with it;
- Different methods to solve a system of linear equations;
- And some other functions.

I am looking forward to add new functionality soon such as:
- Boolean (binary) Matrix implementation;
- Matrix class iterator;
- Vector class;
- New methods to solve system of linear equations;
- Complex number class.
